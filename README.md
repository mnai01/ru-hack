## The Inspiration
The world's a very isolated place now as of the outbreak of COVID-19. Far Friends aims to connect people across the world, because we're all in this together.

## The Project
We've created an application where users from around the world can connect with each other and keep socializing throughout this rough time. On the front page you can monitor COVID in each country with our map that updated live. You can see the most recent users online and view each others profile to find the best Far Friend for this pandemic.

## The Building
- Backend hosting using Heroku
- Database hosting using Heroku ClearDB
- Backend using Node & Express (Julian & Josh)
- Frontend using React + Global State (Ian & Bryan)
- The Difficulties
- Our team ran in to many difficulties, from internet connection issues, 2 final exam conflicts, and members frequently missing.

## The Accomplishments
This was a large, ambitious project for us to complete. Perhaps too large, but what we did get done is an achievement in and of itself!

## The Lessons
- Global State Management within React
- Authentication using Node
- Password Encryption using bcrypt
- Hosting a MySQL Database using Heroku ClearDB
- Accessing MySQL Databases using Chrome MySQL Admin

## The Future
We have many plans for the future of this project, including adding the ability to actually send messages to other users. We have prepared database tables to create this functionality, but still need to do more.
